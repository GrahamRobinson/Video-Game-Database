# Video-Game-Database
The goal of this project was to use C# and Visual Studio to create a database of our chosen topic and to allow a user to edit the information found within each entry and to also delete entries or add new entries to the database.

At the top of the page there are filters such as the platform a game is played on or the genre of the game, by clicking these filters the results shown to the user will be limited to the specified restrictions.

Below are some screenshots of the project being used;
